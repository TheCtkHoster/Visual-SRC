# Visual Blade Ball Script Source [Updated UI]

I have decided to release this because the owner [Tevfn] skidded the entire script from Nurysium and pretends like he made the entire script by himself. He didn't even give credit whatsoever.

Loadstring: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCtkHoster/Visual-SRC/main/visual.lua",true))()```
